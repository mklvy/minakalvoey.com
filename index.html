<div class="maintext" style="color: white"><p><i>WARP (Act 1)</i> premiered at the Pogo Bar, KW Institute for Contemporary Art in Berlin, April 2024. It takes us on the journeys of Ae and Em, who find themselves in worlds that are separate but joint, wandering from one place and time to another. Em, trapped in a digital mirror world is seeking a way back, while Ae navigates a disorienting reality resembling ours–only to become increasingly distorted. Through a shared narrative, they encounter various characters one might meet in online forums, on social media and IRL: The Imps, The Gatekeeper, The Guardian and the Jesters. Hidden portals act as gateways and barriers as they try to connect with their surroundings, and each other. <br><br>The performance is accompanied by a soundscape composed by Christopher Schmidt. Performance documentation photos by Zhiyuan Yang, and image visual by Veronika Valtonen.</p></div>

<!---<hr><div class="maintext" style="color: white"><p><i>moths,</i> 2024</div>
<div class="maintext" style="color: white"><p>“I said: I keep seeing moths everywhere,” I shouted again. I couldn’t believe I had to repeat myself a third time. They were stopped in their tracks across the street, staring at me, not saying a word. Over the past few weeks moths had started to appear everywhere I went. A name sign on a neighbour’s door had morphed into a massive moth as I passed by in the hallway. A smudged out, dusty mark on a wall became smudged out, dead moth. A piece of paper clinging to the sticky kitchen floor tiles seemed to flutter its wings.<br><br>As time passed by I began collecting the moth-like items as I came across them. Due to a lack of space in my room, already filled to the brim with trinkets, a small altar had started to take shape on one of my window sills. As if handling precious puzzle pieces, some even glittered in the sun, I placed each object with the greatest care.<br><br>The night before I saw them stood across from me on the street, I had a strange dream. Giant bat-moths were eating away the walls of my flat, from the inside out. I didn’t get to the part where I had actually seen them, but hearing them chew through the insulation, brick, and wood had sent shivers down my spine, even in my sleep. When I woke up the next morning, the shrine of collected artefacts looked different, as though the objects had been moved and put back in the wrong place.<br><br>Out on the street again that evening, I stared back at them, wondering why they weren’t answering. I tried to mirror their body language to provoke them. Tilted my head as theirs were tilted, lifted my arms slightly out from my torso as theirs were lifted slightly out. It had gotten darker outside, and the street lamps turned on. In one swift moment they all snapped their heads up towards the glowing lamp, their necks cracking like dry branches. A small jump, and they flew up towards the bulb. I stood watching them fly frantically into it, the yellow light flickering each time they hit it. One of them hit the bulb with such force that he fell down on the ground, it made a hollow sound. I sighed, walked over, and started dragging his limp body inside.</p></div>

<div class="maintext" style="color: white"><p>there was that feeling of the organised chaos that occurs when a group of people scurry around to find a nice, comfortable seat for the hour-long drive when he plumped down next to me. the middle-aged man with shoulder length, black, box dyed hair, who was wearing a white shirt with the top buttons undone, black leather pants and a big leather bracelet with a buckle around his wrist.<br><br>he sat down and pulled his laptop up from his bag and i peaked over, couldn’t not. i peaked over and saw that yahoo was his default search engine, i saw him trying in vain to open facebook in his browser, the wifi on the bus didn’t work well enough for him to check the number of notifications and messages that had accumulated from wherever in the world he was traveling from.<br><br>i quickly looked out the window to cover for myself, to not linger too long on his bright screen, eyes flickering as they clung to trees, bushes and cars in the dull motorway landscape. grey concrete mixed with the colours of the sunset. i had taken my outerwear off earlier, and was starting to feel the cold draft in the bus.<br><br>he opened the notes app and at the end of many other entries he wrote, as a reminder to his future self,<br><br><br><br><i>block nancy</i></p></div>

Readers enter a chat room and are presented with the character's personal notes, as well as questionnaires and tests from a guide.

<div class="maintext" style="color: white"><p><i>The Waiting Room</i> (2022–) is an ongoing web-based work of interactive fiction inspired by reality shifting – a phenomenon described as "transcending" one's consciousness to a desired reality. In the first instalment "The Waiting Room", readers take control of a character lost in the search for entertainment, navigating between rooms through a text-based interface to reveal the character's backstory. Each room's description is randomly generated, ensuring unique play-throughs. When exhibited, a thermal printer makes it possible for visitors to print their story to bring home.<br><br><i>Web development by David Barriga Ruano, technical support by Julian Netzer.</i><a href="https://minakalvoey.com/wr/" target="blank"><br><br>&#9741; Link to read – desktop only</a></p></div>

<div class="maintext" style="color: white"><p><i>Grand Opening!</i> is a LARP based on research done on the BER Airport. The airport finally opened in October 2020, 8 years after the initial opening date in 2012. The LARP is inspired by several anecdotes on what happened during those years – such as the dress rehearsals that were held, the people hired to run empty trains and flush airport toilets, and the idea of using students as human fire alarms. <i>Grand Opening!</i> consists of 11 characters, a backstory, campaigns and rules.</p></div>
