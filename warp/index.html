<div class="maintext" style="color: white"><p><i>WARP (Act 1)</i> premiered at the Pogo Bar, KW Institute for Contemporary Art in Berlin, April 2024. It takes us on the journeys of Ae and Em, who find themselves in worlds that are separate but joint, wandering from one place and time to another. Em, trapped in a digital mirror world is seeking a way back, while Ae navigates a disorienting reality resembling ours–only to become increasingly distorted. Through a shared narrative, they encounter various characters one might meet in online forums, on social media and IRL: The Imps, The Gatekeeper, The Guardian and the Jesters. Hidden portals act as gateways and barriers as they try to connect with their surroundings, and each other. <br><br>The performance is accompanied by a soundscape composed by Christopher Schmidt. Performance documentation photos by Zhiyuan Yang, and image visual by Veronika Valtonen.</p></div>
