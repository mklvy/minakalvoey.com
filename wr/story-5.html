  <div class="storyText mono" onClick="goToRoom()">nice, i thought you might want to try. it can take a while to get right, but the method i’ve found most helpful is one where you lay on your back in a starfish position, make sure your limbs aren’t touching. start counting to 100 while visualising the place you want to go. you can even use affirmations, but i usually skip those. once you go to sleep you should wake up where you want. careful though, it’s not dangerous or anything but you could get stuck in this kind of in-between space. good luck and enjoy, see you around maybe</div>
